# Project Writeup and Reflection

#### 1. Project Overview
**For this assignment, I used data sources from different subreddit of Reddit, including r/mamamoo (my main observing target), r/red_velvet, r/straykids, and r/twice. I began the process by using a histogram function to create a dictionary of words in the top 50 post from mamamoo, and I used different summary statistics to summarize the main topics in the subreddit currently. Additionally, I also used NLTK sentiment analysis to analyze the overall, or the average, positivity or neutrality of the posts. Lastly, I used the text similarity technique (fuzzywuzzy library) to find the similarity between the k-pop group Mamamoo, and other k-pop groups like Red Velvet (which has different audience), Twice (which has very different style), and Stray Kids (which is a boy's group). By comparing them, I hope to find whether or not their audience has different behaviors or reactions towards the group, when the k-pop groups have different style and gender.**
